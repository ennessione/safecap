## Safecap

# Overview

SafeCap is a modelling environment integrating a number of verification and simulation techniques. It assists railway engineers in designing track layouts and signalling principles for achieving optimal capacity utilisation, while ensuring system safety. 

SafeCap supports the microscopic analysis of a railway node (station, marshalling yard, junction or a small network consisting of few stations) with the purpose of investigating, in the most detailed way possible, its performance for various service patterns, train types, and stability margins. SafeCap relies on computer science techniques to define and manipulate track schemas and control tables, and to encode custom laws of train operation. This makes it possible to employ advanced computer-aided design (CAD) techniques that are common in the analysis of safety critical hardware and software, i.e. automated verification of safety properties using theorem provers and constraint solvers.

The SafeCap verification method is supported by a versatile toolkit for analysing railway system safety and capacity. The approach is based on the formulation of railway schema properties and operational principles using a rigorous mathematical notation. The main unique characteristic of the toolset is full formal verification of system safety (the push-button proof of safety) â€“ this level of automated safety verification makes it superior to any approaches relying exclusively on simulation. Moreover it has potential to change the design practice as it makes it easier for the developers to explore and compare various designs always ensuring their safety.
